# Subbly Checkout Code

We are excited to open-source our checkout code and share it with the community. This initial release marks the first version of our open-source checkout system, and we aim to make it as
robust and user-friendly as possible.

To ensure we can provide adequate support and gather valuable feedback, we are currently granting access to the private
repository on a case-by-case basis. This approach allows us to assist users individually, addressing any issues and
incorporating suggestions for improvement more effectively. By managing access manually, we hope to create a more
collaborative and supportive environment for everyone involved.

If you are interested in accessing the open-source checkout code, please fill out this Google form.

reviewed, we will grant you access to the private repository. Thank you for your interest and cooperation!
